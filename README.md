# Adjusting HTML elements and links to be optimized for search engines

## Description
- This completed project allows you to access marketing information and strategy and to direct you to each section of the webpage that describes each section of information in detail.
- We used a series of html elements to provide a proper structure for the webpage and divide descriptions of marketing strategies as well as applied CSS to attract user attention to our main product information.
- This web page was difficult to maintain a balanced front of detail that expressed the ideas and flavor of the company, however, it has proven successful and we hope to enhance the style and increase the information our company provides to the public in the world of marketing.
